**TO:** Board of Directors, NC KTZ JSC
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor
**DATE:** 2026-02-11
**SUBJECT:** Cloud Computing For Big Data

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
NC KTZ JSC is a "Digital Immigrant" operating primarily in "IT Service Mode" (Feature Factory). While there are pockets of successful digital implementation (e.g., Tez Customs), the organization relies heavily on project-based funding, vendor partnerships (Wabtec, Huawei), and a compliance-driven mindset rather than empowered, persistent product teams.

**2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)**
*   **Project-Based Mindset**: The Annual Report consistently frames technology as discrete initiatives with fixed end dates, such as the "Trip Optimiser Project... scheduled for completion in 2025" and the "Single Digital Window (SDW) Project."
    *   *Risk:* This "stop-start" funding model prevents continuous iteration and optimization, leading to decaying software as soon as the "project" is closed.
*   **Mercenary Language**: The text abounds with language of "compliance with requirements," "execution of strategies," and "implementation of systems" (134 matches for "requirement" vs. nearly zero for "empowered teams").
    *   *Risk:* Teams focus on pleasing stakeholders and checking boxes rather than solving underlying customer problems.
*   **Outsourcing Core Competency**: Strategic digital capabilities are often bought or partnered rather than built (e.g., "KinetiX digital system was transferred to NC KTZ JSC" from Wabtec).
    *   *Risk:* The company fails to build internal innovation muscle, remaining dependent on external vendors for its "digital brain."

**3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS**
The company lists "Digitalisation" as a core strategic goal (Goal 4) and claims to be a "foundation for sustainable business growth." However, the organizational structure remains traditional:
*   **Innovation vs. Execution**: "Digitalisation" is treated as a separate vertical (Goal 4) rather than the fabric of the business (Goals 1-3).
*   **Output vs. Outcome**: While the "Tez Customs" platform achieved a great outcome (processing time reduced from 8 hours to 30 minutes), it is celebrated as a "pilot project implemented" (Output) rather than the work of a persistent team optimising a funnel (Outcome).

**4. THE PRESCRIPTION**
To shift from Project-based to Product-based management, KTZ must:
*   **Fund Teams, Not Projects**: Transition from annual budgeting for "digital projects" to funding persistent Product Teams (e.g., a "Transit Efficiency Team" or "Customer Portal Team") with long-term mission objectives.
*   **Bring Tech "In-House"**: Move from vendor-management to value-creation. Engineers and Product Managers should be core employees who own the code and the outcome, reducing reliance on "transferred" systems.
*   **Redefine Success**: Stop measuring "project completion" and start measuring "continuous impact" (e.g., "Increase daily active users on SDW" rather than "Launch SDW").
