# Executive Summary: "SmartSpec" AI Agent (Go/No-Go Decision)

**TO:** Investment Committee, NC KTZ JSC
**FROM:** Product Strategy Lead
**DATE:** 2026-02-11
**SUBJECT:** Cloud Computing For Big Data

## 1. Recommendation: GO (Conditioned on On-Premises Deployment)
We recommend immediate funding for the **SmartSpec** prototype. The project offers a 10x ROI within Year 1 while mitigating critical compliance risks, provided strictly defined data residency protocols are followed.

## 2. Financial Reasoning (The ROI Case)

### Base Assumptions
*   **Average Salary:** 473,477 KZT/month (Source: 2024 Annual Report, p.6).
*   **Burdened Cost:** ~615,000 KZT/month (Salary + 30% Taxes/Benefits/Overhead).
*   **Target Users:** 500 Active Users (200 Procurement Specialists + 300 Key Engineers).
*   **Time Savings:** 10 hours/week per user (25% of FTE) by eliminating manual "redlining" and rework loops.

### Value Calculation (Annual)
1.  **Cost per Hour:** 615,000 KZT / 160 hours = **3,844 KZT/hour**.
2.  **Savings per User:** 10 hours/week * 48 weeks * 3,844 KZT = **1,845,120 KZT/year**.
3.  **Total Operational Savings:** 1,845,120 KZT * 500 Users = **922.5 Million KZT/year ($1.9M USD)**.

### Investment vs. Return
*   **Estimated Cost:** 150 Million KZT (Development + Local Server Infrastructure).
*   **ROI Year 1:** (922.5M - 150M) / 150M = **515%**.
*   **Payback Period:** < 3 Months.

## 3. Governance & Ethics Check (The "Kazakhstan Test")

### 3.1. Data Sovereignty (Law on Personal Data)
*   **Risk:** Sending internal contracts or technical specs to public LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude) violates Kazakhstan's data residency laws and internal "Commercial Secret" policies.
*   **Mitigation:** The AI model must be "Localised." We will use an open-weights model (e.g., Llama 3 or Mistral) hosted on **KTZ's on-premise private cloud** in Astana. No data leaves the corporate perimeter.

### 3.2. Transparency & Explainability
*   **Risk:** "Black Box" rejection of tenders could lead to corruption allegations or unfair bias against certain vendors/standards.
*   **Mitigation:** The AI is configured as a "Co-pilot," not an "Autopilot."
    *   It **never** rejects a document automatically.
    *   It **must** cite the specific regulatory clause (e.g., "Samruk-Kazyna Rule 4.2") for every suggestion.
    *   The human officer retains 100% final decision authority (Human-in-the-Loop).

### 3.3. Bias & Fairness
*   **Risk:** The model could over-index on "legacy" successful tenders, potentially excluding new, innovative local suppliers who don't fit the old text patterns.
*   **Mitigation:** Regular "Fairness Audits" where a human committee reviews a random sample of AI suggestions to ensure they encourage competition rather than enforcing historical monopolies.

## 4. Strategic Alignment
This initiative directly operationalizes **Goal 4 (Digitalisation)** and **Goal 5 (ESG)** by embedding sustainability rules into the procurement lifecycle at the source. It shifts KTZ from a "Reactive Compliance" posture to a "Proactive Quality" posture.
